how the multiplayer works?

RULES!

1. minimum of players are 2 (the host person + person who joined = 2)
2. maximum of players are 10 (the host person + 9 person = 10)
3. the carousel grid is serves for players that are waiting they'r turn and it suppose to display they'r name and they'r game board
4. when the turn is over the the grid will change with the net player grid
5. important! e.g lets say we have 3 or more players .. Marius,Alex,Ovi and is Marius turn. Marius can challenge any opponent (Alex or Ovi) by select it from carousel grid.
   e.g Marius challenge -> Ovi he shoot and he end his turn . next is Alex . well Alex can challenge Marius or Ovi
